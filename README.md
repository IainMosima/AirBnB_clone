Description of the project.
This is the first phase of building a full web application "The AirBnB"

The project is linked in the following ways: put in place a parent class 
(called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and 
deserialization of your future instances create a simple flow of serialization/
deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file create all 
classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place‚Ä¶) that inherit from 
BaseModel create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File 
storage. create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

In this project, we want to manage the following objects: Create a new object 
(ex: a new User or a new Place) Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc‚Ä¶
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc‚Ä¶) Update attributes of an 
object Destroy an object
Data (python objects) generated are stored in a json file and can be accessed 
with the help of the json module in python

Description of the Command interpreter.

A command interpreter is used to manipulate data without a visual interface, 
like a shell (for development and debugging) A website (front-end) with static 
and dynamic functionalities. A comprehensive database to manage the backend 
functionalities.
This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where 
users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP 
programming.

Some of the commands available are:

show
create
update
destroy
count
And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with 
the backend and file storage system, the folowing actions can be performed:

Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc‚Ä¶
Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc‚Ä¶)
Updating attributes of an object
Destroying an object

HOW TO APPROACH IT.

You will need to clone the repository of the project from Github. This will 
contain the simple shell program and all of its dependencies.
 
git clone https://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@github.com/Mwobobia/
AirBnB_clone.git

After cloning the repository you will have a folder called AirBnB_clone. 
In here there will be several files that allow the program to work.

/console.py : The main executable of the project, the command interpreter.

models/engine/file_storage.py: Class that serializes instances to a JSON file 
and deserializes JSON file to instances

models/__ init __.py: A unique FileStorage instance for the application

models/base_model.py: Class that defines all common attributes/methods for 
other classes.

models/user.py: User class that inherits from BaseModel

models/state.py: State class that inherits from BaseModel

models/city.py: City class that inherits from BaseModel

models/amenity.py: Amenity class that inherits from BaseModel

models/place.py: Place class that inherits from BaseModel

models/review.py: Review class that inherits from BaseModel

HOW TO USE IT.
It works with both Interactive and non-interactive modes

IN INTERACTIVE MODE, it allows a developer to interact with their application 
in real-time and test new features and functionality. It's an essential when 
working on an application like the Airbnb clone. 
The console will display a prompt (hbnb) indicating that the user can write 
and execute a command. After the command is run, the prompt will appear again 
a wait for a new command. This can go indefinitely as long as the user does 
not exit the program.
Example:
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
 
NON-INTERACTIVE MODE,(Like the shell project in C) in the Airbnb console is a 
way of running commands in a batch or script mode, without requiring user 
input. This mode is useful for automating tasks, performing repetitive actions,
and running complex commands that require multiple inputs.
  Create script
  Import modules
  Write commands
  Save and run the script
  View the output
In this mode no prompt will appear, and no further input will be expected from 
the user.
Example:
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
 
AIRBNB CONSOLE
This project is the first step towards building a full web application: the 
AirBnB clone.

The console or command interpreter create the data model and allows create, 
update, destroy, store and persist objects to a file (JSON file). This console 
will be a tool to validate this storage engine.

Console commands
The commands available for this command interpreter are:

Name	Description
*create -	Creates a new instance of the class passed by argument.
show	- Prints the string representation of an instance.
*destroy	- Deletes an instance that was already created.
all	- Prints string representation of all instances or of all instances of a 
specified class.
*update -	Updates an instance attribute if exists otherwise create it.
help	- Show all commands or display information about a specific command.
quit -	Exit the console.
EOF -	Exit the console.
 
*create, destroy and update commands save changes into a JSON file.

COMMANDS USAGE:
