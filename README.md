Description of the project.
This is the first phase of building a full web application "The AirBnB"

The project is linked in the following ways: put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage. create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

In this project, we want to manage the following objects: Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place) Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc… Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…) Update attributes of an object Destroy an object
Data (python objects) generated are stored in a json file and can be accessed with the help of the json module in python

Description of the Command interpreter.

A command interpreter is used to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging) A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities. A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities.
This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

Some of the commands available are:

show
create
update
destroy
count
And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the folowing actions can be performed:

Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Updating attributes of an object
Destroying an object
